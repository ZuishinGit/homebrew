If the save succeeds, the spirit can't possess that goblin for 24 hours.

					"Moridna Nashen was once a promising necromancer who was apprentice to Shradin Mulophor, the Lord of Bones. As Moridna's powers grew, Mulophor grew worried about his position in Undermountain and eventually asked Halaster to devise an artifact that he would later use to transfigure Moridna permanently. Thus, a spellbook containing sacred lore was created through one of Halaster's wishes. Mulophor presented the spellbook as a gift to his apprentice, to which Moridna graciously accepted, as truthfully he looked up to Mulophor. Upon opening the spellbook, Moridna's body was horribly disfigured and was locked away in a ruined chamber somewhere lost to time. He was left eternally resentful towards his master, and did everything he could to somehow obtain his previous form once more, to no avail."
