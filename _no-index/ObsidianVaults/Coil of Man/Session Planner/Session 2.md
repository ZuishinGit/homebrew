# Purphoros' Ordeal

###### Recap:
> I think our long break warrants a brief summary of events so far.
> 
> So a few weeks ago, the stars, which are closely tied to the Gods of this realm started falling. Approached by Namfoodle Stardiggle, the astromancer of Fala, you guys set out to search for Thassa's Oracle, and apparently so did house Vol. The Oracle then ushered you to Nyx by seeking out Black Mamba, who brought you to the Temple of Mysteries. On the way, you encountered Xenophanes, a powerful demon from the underworld who had taken over Fairhollow. You managed to get out of his domain and found your way to the Temple of Mysteries, where you solved a few puzzles and entered Nyx. It became apparent to you all that Nyx was not as it seemed, as you awoke in Nylea's forest, which has been overtaken by demonic fungus. You decided to help the plagued inhabitants by taking out Acantha, an elven druid turned monster, meeting Thunderwing along the way. After slaying Acantha, you activated a corrupted Fairy Ring, which led all of you to the Underworld, where you fought a few demons and found a young wizard who lay cloistered in his tower. You used the last Wish of your Ring of Three Wishes to go back to Nyx to seek audience with the Gods. It succeeded, and you found out from Keranos that the Titans which were bound in the underworld are rousing from their slumber, and for some reason Kruphix is preventing the Nyxian gods from interfering. In fact, you learned that Heliod and Nylea are entirely missing from their domains.
> 
> Keranos has convinced himself that this is a plot of Erebos, and has entrusted you with the job of stopping Erebos, whether that means by killing him or by convincing him.
> 
> Last we left off, you guys had been ushered to the sweltering chambers of Purphoros, God of the Forge, where you learned he was crafting a weapon capable of slaying divines. Before entrusting it to you, he wished to test your capabilities as heroes by beseeching unto you a divine ordeal.
>
> Your vision comes back to you. 

## Success
Purphoros hesitantly gives them Clavos, the shortsword, warning them of their new destiny. 

## Failure
Purphoros sorrowfully exclaims that it is not their destiny to wield his blade, though that does not mean they are not important, they have made it to Nyx after all. What they do from here is up to them.

Regardless of success or failure, Purphoros grants them a host of bronze pegasi that can traverse the realms of Nyx with ease; alternatively, he offers to craft a gateway to the mortal realm.

## Back to the Underworld
The characters may find themselves back in the Saprophytic Isles, with the tower of Kruu'Gall still in its place.
