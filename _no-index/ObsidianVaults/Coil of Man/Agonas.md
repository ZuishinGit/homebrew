> Agonas, the last home of warriors and fallen soldiers who died without honor, as well as the souls of cowards, mercenaries, and others who lived by sword or dagger. You can feintly hear the cries of pain and triumph echo on the frigid wind.
>
> This bleak, rocky expanse seems endless. Over the ridges and canyons, miles away, you can see a titanic, rusting chain coming from the sky above, from which hangs a massive, cruel-looking, circular palace of dark stone. It looms over a clutter of ruinous structures and earthen spires.
> 
> You can see, about 200 feet away, 3 hulking figures covered in scraps of dark clothing that billow in the wind. All of them are at least twice your size, and can be seen shambling towards you.

The cyclopes approach the party and lead them to "their next battle", but before that they must pass the Phylaskia guards of Agonas. To test their mettle, the Phylaskia ask the adventurers to slay an innocent, caged man who has been blindfolded and has torturous wounds.

## Adventures in Agonas

***A Way Out.*** A patron of the [[Blood Pyxis]] known as Theriatis Vol knows how to get in and out of the Underworld, but he won't reveal his secret to just anyone. A character can find him by succeeding a DC 18 Investigation check and spending at least 1 hour talking to the denizens of Agonas. They can otherwise get his attention at the [[Blood Pyxis]], and he will approach them alone.

## Denizens of Agonas

***Duerphaloi.*** Dwarves without head. These silent creatures are stout with a dark complexion, and they communicate through touch. They are vestiges of the most prideful of demonkind, who have lost their heads due to one myth or another.

## The Sights in Agonas

***Sunken Statue.*** A massive, weathered statue depicting a hoplite plunging his spear in the neck of a woman, and hoisting her up. It is sunken into the rocky ground.

***Theater of Despair.*** A large, white ampitheater carved from the skull of a giant.
If the characters wish to see the play:
> At the center of the ampitheater, it seems a drama is underway. A man donning a golden mask stands above a makeshift bed, sprawled upon the bed is a man who is obviously dressed like a woman, wearing a wig and a woman's dress.
>
> The masked man says 
> "With great sorrow, princess, I bid thee farewell. This will be the first murder of our new empire, and I will see to it that it is in the name of justice". 
> 
> The crossdressing man on the bed looks like he is in some kind of stupor, and tries to respond but can't get the words out of his mouth. In that moment, the masked man takes out a jewel-encrusted dagger and rushes to plunge it into the stupefied actor. The man's blood stains the bed's white sheets and the previously silent crowd erupts into cheers and applause as the masked man does a short bow and then slowly walks out of view â€” behind the ampitheater walls.

If the characters linger, they see the clean-up crew consisting of a host of ghouls that begin to consume the corpse and remove the makeshift bed.

***Marketplace of Rust.*** A dilapitated plaza is rife with activity, as people are bartering for weapons and armor, most of which are rusted and completely useless in a real fight. Between some crumbling buildings, an old man wanders up to the characters
> "You look like you have things to trade! I invite you to inspect my wares!" 
> He wanders back between some crumbling buildings and shouting merchants, urging you to follow.
>
> You arrive at a small hovel carved into the base of a pillar of rock at the end of a narrow alley. He opens the crackled door and invites you in.

The man's name is Issanros, and he sells rusty weapons, but also sells a *Dread Helm* (100 - 200 gp), *Wyvern Poison* (1000 - 2000 gp), and a *Shield of Missile Attraction* (500 - 800 gp).

Issanros complains that he would have more interesting items to sell, but he and the other merchants are always being robbed by bandits from the [[Matriarch's Grotto|matriarch's grotto]].
