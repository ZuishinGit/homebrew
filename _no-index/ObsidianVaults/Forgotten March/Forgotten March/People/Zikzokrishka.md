# Zikzokrishka

###### Adult Blue Dracolich (Female)

###### Neutral Evil

Long ago, Zikzokrishka, seeking the nether scroll housed in the Azumar's necropolis, had ransacked the city only to find that the ancient abjuring magic of [[Prince Hamukai]] prevented further entry. She sequestered herself above the tomb of Hamukai, lying in wait for an opportunity to breach the magically protected sanctum.

Centuries later, Zikzokrishka had awakened at the sight of Hamukai's golem within her chambers, a golem that she knew was the key to Hamukai's tomb. The golem was escorted by the Knights of the March and, failing to plea with the party, the dracolich Zikzokrishka was slain at their behest.

Now, her body rejuvinates near her phylactery in [[Wyrmdoom Gorge]], overseen by [[Zedaar, the Chanter]].

##### Zikzokrishka's Phylactery

Zikzokrishka's phylactery took the form of a large translucent lustrous black sapphire with blue glowing highlights that rested on an ornate ivory pedestal. The entire arrangement was designed to look like sharp talons clutching a black orb and was worth 20,000 gp in raw materials. 

The pedestal was enchanted with Fell sigils that surrounded it in magically darkened fog. The fog permeated openings and around corners, enshrouding the area in a 500 foot radius. A creature could use their action to make a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disable the sigils without destroying the phylactery.

The Knights of the March have destroyed the phylactery after defeating its guardian, [[Zedaar, the Chanter]]. The phylactery was shattered and a necrotic wave of energy was released in a 60 foot radius, dealing 40 (16d4) necrotic damage. (AC 20; HP 20; Damage Threshold 5; resistance to all damage from spells)
