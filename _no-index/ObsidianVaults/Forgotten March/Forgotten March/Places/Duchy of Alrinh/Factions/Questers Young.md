# Questers

***Motto.*** "Choose to fight for those who lack the choice."

***Beliefs.*** The questers beliefs can be summarized as follows:
- The greatest prospect of adventure is glory. 
- To sit idly while the world takes action is a sure path to cowardice. 
- Those who are incapable of protecting themselves deserve a helping hand; those who still try in the face of futility deserve respect.

***Goals.*** It is a duty of a quester to accept tasks of all kinds. Masons and carpenters help repair buildings, and fighters help ward off orc and goblin raids.

***Typical Quests.*** Typical quests include escorting a merchant or a caravan through bandit territory, recovering peasants who were kidnapped in an orc night raid, or hunting down a criminal who has escaped from a dungeon.

***Leader.*** [[Erik "Patch" Steiner]], a youthful human man who lost his eye in a fight with a grotesque hill giant.
