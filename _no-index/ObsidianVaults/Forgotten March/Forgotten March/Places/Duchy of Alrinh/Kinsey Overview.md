# Kinsey
> Kinsey, the archival city — home of the Great Alrinhian Academy.

Built upon the ruins of an ancient city, Kinsey is where scholars make their stay. It is a sprawling haven for academia, abounding with treatises, records, and scrolls. Most of its citizens get caught up in the aristocratic life of wizardry and the upper echelons of academia. As a result, they often lack the social sensibilities that would have been taught through experience.

## Nobility
3 prominent noble families exist, and each have a respective court in the [[Great Alrinhian Academy]]. They are known as the solemn chambers of Kinsey.

***Chamber Rellencia.*** Predating all other noble families, this human house procures spells and arcane implements for the purposes of war. They rose to their height of prominence during Alrinh's defense from the raids of Nevania. Now, the conflicts between the Duchy and the Urogan may spark new purpose in the Rellencias. They are solely in charge of the prison

***Chamber Kellimeus.***
