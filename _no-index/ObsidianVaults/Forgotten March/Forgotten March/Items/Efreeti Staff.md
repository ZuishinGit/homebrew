# Efreeti Staff
You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [burning hands](https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/spells.html#burning%20hands_phb) (1 charge), [fireball](https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/spells.html#fireball_phb) (3 charges), or [wall of fire](https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/spells.html#wall%20of%20fire_phb) (4 charges).

***Sentient.*** The *Efreeti Staff* is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a warm sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.

***Personality.*** The staff has the personality of an Efreeti â€” a cruel, deceitful slaver. It desires to amass a wealth of serfs wherever possible, and hates being told what to do.

If a creature tries to use the *Efreeti Staff* against the efreeti's will, it can cause the staff to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the staff takes 9 (2d8) fire damage, and they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or drop the staff if it can. If the creature doesn't drop the staff, they have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of their next turn.
