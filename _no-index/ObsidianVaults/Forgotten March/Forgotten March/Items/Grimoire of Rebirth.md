# Grimoire of Rebirth
When you die, your soul is called into a new body which is created in a safe place within 1 mile of where you died. If no such place exists, this reincarnation fails.

The created body is of an ancestry appropriate to where it was created, or determined randomly by the DM as per the reincarnate spell, though the body is that of a newborn baby. The creature retains its memories, though is subject to normal mental development that is characteristic of the race.

***Curse.*** A creature reincarnated by this item is plagued by painful tinnitus, which pervades through all forms of their potential incarnations, including other methods of revival, and is preventable only by a wish spell. If the creature becomes deafened, they are relieved of the symptoms for the length of their condition, but the curse still lingers.
