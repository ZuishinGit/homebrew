# Session Outline
## Hill Giants Battle Aftermath
***Dead Bodies.*** The dead humanoids appear to be soldiers of the Urogan, wearing black armor displaying some militaristic heraldry. A creature with a soldier background can recognize this was an important scouting party for nobility.

***Treasure.*** There are a dozen humanoids in total. Most of their black armor has been sundered, but 4 sets appear salvageable. They each have 33 (6d10) gp (total 6d10 $\times$ 12). In a small chest, they have a scroll of parchment with goblin scribblings on it (a writ of passage), and a sealed scroll. They also had some mundane supplies: 2 explorer's packs worth of goods, a massive tent, 2 vials of antitoxin, and a spyglass that has broken in the chaos. The only thing the giants had was a ridiculously thick 100 feet long rope, which weighs a total of 50 pounds.

***Survivor Horse.*** One of the horses is still alive, though it has a broken leg, curable by any amount of magical healing. The horse, named Bastion, is a warhorse with a dapple grey coat. Here is what it knows:
- "We have been going without rest for some days to deliver a message...all the way from the fortress at the lakeside."
- "Ahead is a dark wood filled with terrible spiders, but past that is a city."
- "My master was good, he never hurt anybody and always gave me food and water. He would even brush my hair."
- "We were in a hurry because soon the snow will fall."
- "There's a man in the city who always talks friendly to me... he has great wings, like a bird, and he is just as nice as master."

***Writ of Passage.*** The writ of passage is in Orcish. A creature who can read Orcish can tell that it demands safe passage into Bulag Uul by order of House Bozik.

***Sealed Letter.*** The sealed letter, written in common, is addressed to someone named Barithiel. It says that the men in Adra are anxiously awaiting his return, and that they can not proceed without him. It then mentions that should he finish his business with the orcs, he should use an attached sigil sequence to hasten his return.

The sigil sequence is accurate, and leads to a wizard's tower within a few miles of Adra.

## Leaving the Denelgal Area
> Your journey takes you away from the hillside and into a dense, dark wood with no signs of civilization. The approaching winter has left all the trees without their leaves. Instead, you notice huge whisps of silk webbing that have collected all along the canopy, dense enough to block light from passing. You'll be moving blindly unless you have a light source.

## In the Weaver's Wood

The weaver's wood is infested with ettercaps. After an hour, the characters stumble upon something interesting:

> As you walk through the dark wood, your boots continually get caught on sticky webs. You can occasionally feel bugs crawling around in your clothing, and sometimes catch fleeting glimpses of massive spiders, their beady eyes reflecting the light. Eventually you stop at a section of the wood which is completely overtaken by webs. You can't even see the ground. At the center of this small clearing, 30 feet away from you, hanging from the canopy by thick strands of web, is a suspended sack which looks suspiciously humanoid.

***Ettercap Ambush.*** There are ettercaps hidden all along the trees. A DC 20 Perception check will notice them.

***Webbed Pitfall.*** The area beneath the webbed humanoid is a pitfall trap covered by light webs. A creature who steps in the area immediately falls 15 feet down, and is covered in webs (the hazard). The pit trap is noticeable with a DC 18 Perception check. If it looks like someone has figured out the trap, the ettercaps attempt to ambush the party, surprising anyone with a Passive Perception lower than 16.

## Road to Bulag Uul

> Over the course of the next few hours, you wade through webs until you notice shafts of sunlight beginning to pierce through the densely woven canopy. It seems you are approaching the edge of this copse. You continue marching until the webs are far behind you, and find yourselves in the outskirts of the forest. Looking ahead, you can see the stumps of trees dotting the area, and now can hear a soft, rhythmic thwacking sound, coming from beyond a hill up ahead.

***Thwacking Sound.*** The sound is of a hobgoblin logging camp. The hobgoblins order around a dozen humanoids bound by chains, including women and children.
