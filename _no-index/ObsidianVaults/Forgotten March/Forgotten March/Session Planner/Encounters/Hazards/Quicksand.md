# Quicksand

###### DC 10 + Target's depth

When a creature enters the area, it sinks 3 (1d4+1) feet and becomes restrained. At the start of each of the creature's turns, it sinks another 2 (1d4) feet. As long as the creature isn't completely submerged in quicksand, it can escape by using its action and succeeding on a Strength check.

A creature fully submerged is at risk of suffocating.

A creature can pull another creature within its reach out of a quicksand pit by using its action and succeeding on a Strength check.
