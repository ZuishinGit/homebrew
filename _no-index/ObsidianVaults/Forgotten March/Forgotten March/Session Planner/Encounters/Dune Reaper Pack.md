# Dune Reaper Pack

Type: Combat
Difficulty: Deadly
Environment: Wilderness

> You hear a terrible, distant, trilling sound that rings and echoes throughout the rocky wastes. Before you have a chance to react, the trilling becomes a powerful warbling as the air around you begins to distort, and you are ambushed by two horrifying creatures.
> 
> These creatures look like a cross between a lizard and a scorpion â€” as tall as you and extremely agile.
> 
> Of their more scorpion features, you notice a multitude of beady eyes, vicious-looking mandibles, and sharp chitinous arms that protrude from their long reptilian body.
> 
> As you're inspecting the two desert horrors before you, a third appears from thin air, letting out a bone-chilling shriek as it lunges to strike.
