# 8th-Level Desert Dungeon

***Creators.*** LG Human worshippers of a nature deity (Nadinis).
***Inhabitants.*** Yuan-ti worshippers of Malkis.
***Purpose.*** Once a temple of Nadinis, now a temple to Malkis.

##### Themes
- Transformation
- Chaos/Unpredictability
- Survival of the fittest — Tribulation
	- Moral dilemma — Self vs Party


### 1. Dried Pool
***Corrupted Statue of Nadinis.*** The statue is dirty and dilapitated, and is missing its head. A character proficient in religion immediately notices she is missing her characteristic staff. The staff is in room 7.

***Restoring the Statue.*** If a character places Nadinis' staff into the statue's hands then the pool starts to flow with vibrant water (roll on the [enchanted springs table](https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/tables.html#enchanted%20springs%3b%20enchanted%20spring%20effects_tce)). Additionally, plants begin to grow in a 6-mile diameter centered on the temple.

***Secret Door.*** The secret door is noticeable without a check.

### 2. Entrance
This entrance is guarded.

#### 2a. Vestibule
This chamber is watched over by the guard in area 2b. There are two banners of Malkis hanging on the southern wall, next to the arrow slits. The room is dominated by a huge brass brazier which has a black flame emitting dim light.

***Brazier.***  The brazier has 18 AC; 18 (4d8) hit points. The brass brazier is a magic item that can be activated by using a bonus action to invoke the command word, "Shirafe" ("blast" in Yuan-ti). When activated, the brazier will cast a firebolt (2d10 fire damage; +4 to hit) on the nearest creature.

***Dart Trap.*** The eastern corridor is trapped. Creatures with a passive perception score of at least 15 will notice the flagstones seem out of place. Stepping on the pressure plate activates darts in the southern wall. They strike the first creature in the corridor with a +8 to hit. On a hit, they deal 2 (1d4) piercing damage, and the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage and being affected by a dormant poison on a failure. On a successful saving throw a creature takes half damage and is not affected by the dormant poison. The poison activates 1d4 hours later, causing the affected creature to regard all creatures it can see as enemies for 1 minute; at the end of their turn, they can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### 2b. Guardsroom
In this room is a Yuan-Ti Malison armed with a Longbow. Additionally, there is a pedestal with a scrying pool that allows the guard to communicate with his boss in area 7. The scrying pool is nasty and contains blackened water.

#### 3. Hall of the Failures
In this room are a series of alcoves that are adorned with the skulls of those that failed the trials of this dungeon. All of the skulls aside from one chatter incessantly, shouting obscenities at the characters. One of these skulls has retained their sapience and knows the following:
- x
- y
- z

#### 4. Room of Sacrifice
> Dominating this room is a large stone platform, on top of which is inscribed a magic circle.

***Magic Circle.*** A DC 15 Arcana check reveals that the magic circle is one that has the capability to transform a creature, adopting snake-like features. It can be activated by sacrificing a living creature and invoking the arcane words inscribed in the circle. A DC 18 Religion check will reveal that the circle once had traces of healing runes and glyphs, but they are damaged and beyond repair.  

A creature that undergoes the transformation gains the ability to speak to snakes (two-way communication), and they gain immunity to poison, and adopt some cosmetic changes as well. This creature also turns Evil alignment.

***Repairing the Circle.*** Once the staff in area 6 is returned to the statue, the gains the ability to affect a  creature with a Greater Restoration spell, and the Bless spell for the next hour. Once this property is used, it can't be used again for 7 days.

#### 5. Boss Room
The lava is 5 feet below ground.
In this room is a Yuan-ti headmaster. He is an Evoker, with the following changes:
- Immunity to poison and poisoned condition.
- Darkvision 60 ft.
- Magic Resistance
- Gains the following lair actions:
	- The lava rises 1d4 feet. 
	- 1d4 + 1 Vargouilles come from the summoning circles
	- Each of the braziers fire a firebolt (2d10; +4 to hit).

#### 6. Reward
Reward!
Roll on the loot hoard table + Staff of Nadinis

#### 7. Twister
Paintings and frescoes that detail the history of the temple as one of Nadinis, showing bountiful farmlands and their human inhabitants. Magically warded against evil creatures (any neutral or evil character that enters the chamber must succeed a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the chamber, and they gain the following flaw until cured by magic: "I never let anyone know the truth about my actions or intentions, even if doing so would be beneficial to me.").

#### Random Encounters
If the party rests in the dungeon, they are ambushed by 2d4 Yuan-ti Malisons.
