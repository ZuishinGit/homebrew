## Introduction
> One way or another, you all have found yourselves indebted to the Holy Carcass-Sons — a mysterious, but very powerful faction in these lands. To encourage you to pay off your debts, the Carcass-Sons have placed a dark brand on each of you — a black hourglass. 
> 
> (You can go to the tables directory and roll for your hourglass location.)
>
> While the hourglass is on your body, you have disadvantage on death saving throws, and food doesn't nourish you — not even goodberries. Your only source of succor are small black pills provided to you by your debtors. You have already had your pill for today, but you know you'll need another tomorrow. Between all of you there are 2d4 pills left. 
> Any attempts to remove this magical mark have previously failed, and you're convinced the only ones who can remove the mark are the Carcass-Sons, which have promised to remove it once your debt is cleared.
>
> Luckily, your debtors have given you an opportunity to clear the slate. You are to find a deep gnome named Roondar Timbers and bring him back to the Carcass-Sons headquarters alive. If you can succeed you will be completely freed from your dues, and, to that end, freed from your mark.
>
> You guys have made your way deep into a swamp, rife with bugs and fantastic creatures

## Deepfen
Deepfen is a swamp village mainly inhabited by Lizardfolk. The people of Deepfen have a tribal hierarchy, with a presiding Chief. They live in small, crude, wooden [yurts](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffcm&q=yurts&iax=images&ia=images). The inhabitants of Deepfen will refuse to interact with outsiders unless they have joined them on a [[Catechism of Bozik#Hunt for the Fen Hydra|hunt]]. They speak draconic to eachother, and only very rarely will one speak common.
## Hunt for the Fen Hydra (30 Minutes)
A troop of Lizardfolk have decided to take on the ultimate challenge: tracking and slaying a Fen Hydra that lurks in the swamps.
