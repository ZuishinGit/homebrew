# Barithiel

#### History

***Fallen Angel of Bahamut.*** In a friendly competition to determine who would be better suited as emissary of Bahamut, Barithiel accidentally slew his close friend -- a fellow servant of Bahamut. From that point on, Barithiel has been forced to reside on the material plane, with all ties to Bahamut severed. His transition from an aspiring servitor (in Celestia) to a being of incredible power (in the material plane) has left him disgusted with the weakness of the world.  In his indefinite exile, he has fostered a misanthropy for the angels and gods of the world, blaming them for his cursed existence among weaker beings. He was left with a want for higher power, or faith. 

***Hope for Redemption.*** His meeting [[Velimir Bozik]] was a relief, as Barithiel was once again instilled with new faith, and a new position as servitor that he felt was not unwarranted. He places faith in the cataclysm, wishing for his cynical view of deities to be erased, which will allow him redemption.

#### Description

***Appearance.*** Barithiel appears as a handsome, powerful, and muscular human with milky iridescent skin. He has wings of a soft gold color, and stands at around 9 feet tall. He is bald, but wears a gleaming circlet of platinum. His nails look as sharp as blades, and are extraordinarily long. 

***Mannerisms.*** He speaks in a deep, commanding voice, and often enunciates overly clearly. He carries himself arrogantly, and is hot-tempered with incompetence.

***Ideals.*** He enjoys having his authority challenged, and will quickly yield to someone he sees as having leader-like qualities (responsibility, charisma, power). He despises flattery and suck-ups, and will lose his temper if he perceives either.

***Weakness.*** While in the presence of the holy symbol of bahamut, Barithiel is considerably weaker.
