						"Pools of water within 90 feet of the aboleth surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a {@dc 14} Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked {@condition prone}. The aboleth can't use this lair action again until it has used a different one.",
						"Water in the aboleth's lair magically becomes a conduit for the creature's rage. The aboleth can target any number of creatures it can see in such water within 90 feet of it. A target must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or take 7 ({@damage 2d6}) psychic damage. The aboleth can't use this lair action again until it has used a different one."

The copy can appear at any location the aboleth has seen before or in any location a creature {@condition charmed} by the aboleth can currently see. Once created, the image lasts for as long as the aboleth maintains concentration, as if concentrating on a spell. Although the image is intangible, it looks, sounds, and can move like the aboleth. The aboleth can sense, speak, and use telepathy from the image's position as if present at that position. If the image takes any damage, it disappears."
