The ubiquity of air travel has made the continents of Erathis an interconnected world, and a nation's concern now ends neither at the water's edge nor the sky's limit, but at the edge of the Pelor's light. Orbiting Erathis are two moons: Sehanine and Ioun (ion). Sehanine is well-known as the ancestral elven homeland and gate to the Feywild and Shadowfell. Ioun orbits farther away and is best known for the arcane potency that manifests around it as well as those who travel there to study it.",
								"Farther beyond, Port Avandra, named wantingly in honor of the goddess of freedom and luck, serves as the final bastion of civilization. Beyond that, skirting the furthest reaches of Pelor's light, lies Tharizdun's Disc -- an asteroid belt of ill omen and great riches. Wrecked hulls of those who went mad amongst the rocks serve as warnings to those daring to delve further into the Black. Stories of what lies beyond warn of behemoth creatures with unfathomable length, but such stories are rare and often mere testimonies of the mad who lost sight of Pelor's light."

This air pocket is not 'poppable,' and can only be removed by consuming all the air inside or by powerful magic. Even if a ship is destroyed, air will still cling to the larger debris.

Where the gravity pulls is what would make sense in atmosphere: For ships, if you fall off the side while in the Aether, you'll keep falling down until you exit the air bubble.

								"{@b High & Eladrin Elves.} Over the millenia many elves have learned to call Erathis home but soon after the advent of aetherflight, many of the high elf enclaves made pilgrimage to Sehanine and started anew. Upon arrival, some high elves chose to live in the Feywild. Their descendants, known as the eladrin, now often venture from the feywild to the material plane in their youth to explore and understand the echo of their world. Despite being relatively new, Arlleuad, the high elf capital city, is well known from the Salts of Drum to Port Avandara.",
								"{@b Drow & Shadar-Kai Elves.} While most peoples know the larger moon as Sehanine, the Drow know it as Nghysgod (giss-god). Just as the High Elves did, the Drow quickly voyaged from Erathis to their ancestral home, but with the intention of creating a nation fully devoted to Lolth. Gwe-cythraul (Gway-keth-isle) stands as a monument to Lolth and the drow who inhabit the city live fully immersed in Lolth's dogma. The Drow have little interest in the Shadowfell but the Raven Queen who rules over the Shadowfell has taken great offense to their sacrilege so close to her domain. The shadar-kai, servants to the Raven Queen, wage war against the Drow to stop their affronts to her realm.",
								"{@b Dwarves.} Most dwarves still call Erathis their home, but the rich prospects of a life amongst the stars has driven many a dwarf away from their underground dwellings. As it turns out, life in a ship isn't much different from life in the mines, and the asteroids of Tharizdun's disc have riches aplenty.",
								"{@b Rock gnomes.} Artificers at heart, these inventive gnomes took quickly to the stars, proving exceptionally gifted towards repairing and maintaining ships, as well as innovating new modifications to be installed. When your battered and bruised airship pulls into a shipyard and a rock gnome steps up to the task, you know you're in good hands.",
								"{@b Warforged.} Believed to be the hand-made creations of Moradin himself, warforged are an extremely rare sight often interpreted as a holy omen to worshippers of Moradin.",
								"{@b Goblins.} Although goblins are rarely seen in cities, towns, or ship crews, their reputation amongst the stars is secured. Not particularly liked, and often joked about with a punchline ending in 'goblin balls', goblins who do find their way into civilization are nevertheless appreciated on any crew for their natural proclivity for sneaking.",
								"{@b Firbolgs.} Stronger than a bear and taller than a goliath, firbolgs have features similar to humans, often with red or blonde hair, thick beards, and fair skin. A firbolg's ancestors are said to have originated from Sehanine and, much like the high elves, returned there through aetherflight. Although firbolgs tend to prefer solitude with nature, the firbolg clans are infamous amongst the Alliance for their role in the Battle of Heddwech Valley during the Sehanine War, where an entire invasion batallion was repelled by them in an extremely pyrrhic victory. It's often told that during this battle, Claio Stonepetal sundered an armored frigate in two with a single swing of his claymore."
