# Wyrmdoom Gorge

This natural ravine is the final resting place of an unnamed Astral Dragon. Its death had wreathed the gorge in planar magic, opening a portal to the Dragon Eyrie. Other dragons can sense the gorge's proximity to the plane of the afterlife, and attracts those that are sick or mortally wounded.
