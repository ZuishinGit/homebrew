# Shar
> Shar, the ringed city — capital of the Great Duchy of Alrinh.

Shar is a city of humility. People with wealth don't often show it, and even the poorest can find accomodations here. Shops are less common than market stands. The city is ripe with symbols and good omens of Pelor, as almost everyone here is an avid worshipper of the deity. There is typically a relaxed nature, and people rarely make a scene.

## Nobility
4 prominent noble families exist, and each have their estate within the innermost ward of Shar.

***House Amakiir.*** Predating all other noble families, this elven house specializes in seafaring and naval exploits. They oversee many portside operations, ranging from coastal trade to naval warfare.

Monsters that can't be trained as pets or guard beasts are sold to arenas or harvested for their meat, bones, and skins. The Fezim sponsor adventuring parties and monster-hunting expeditions, and their motto is "What you fear, we master."

## Architecture
All buildings aside from those outside the city walls are constructed of stonemasonry. A number of aqueducts are used for city water supply, and many grates can be found that lead to the vast sewer system.

### City Layout
Shar gets its name — the ringed city — from its tiered walls. There are three districts, each separated by guarded battlements. The innermost ward is the royal ward, where aristocrats and noble families reside. The intermediary ward is the market ward, where most guilds and trade operate. Beyond that is the gantry, which isn't a ward in actuality, as it is outside Shar's walls. The gantry ward has farm plots, stables, and peasant residences.

Each ward has a few gated entrances that are located conveniently on the roads. The gates remain open until curfew or in times of a potential siege. Each ward has a gate to the docks, which are technically considered a part of the gantry ward, though sometimes they may be refered to as the dock ward.

City Ward|Population
-|-
Dock Ward|1,000 (Low)
Gantry Ward|10,000 (High)
Market Ward|1,000 (Low)
Royal Ward|5,000 (Medium)
Total|17,000

### Sights in Shar

###### Art Installations

***Tower of Pelor.*** A huge lighthouse in the dock ward with a golden star that casts light towards the sea at night.

***Knights of the March.*** A marble statue in the market ward commemorating the original Knights of the March, Gunther, Bardin, and Olivier.

***Fountains, Murals, Mosaics.*** Plenty of art installations exist in the innermost walls of Shar. Most of them depict religious symbology of Pelor, or halfling deities such as Arvoreen.

###### Buildings

***The Shipwreck.*** A portside tavern built to look like a large ship. Many seafaring adventurers spend time and coin here. If the building itself wasn't interesting enough, there's also an awakened pellican that entertains the patrons.

***The Great Mill.*** On the outskirts of Shar is an exceptionally large, riverside mill. It spans 4 stories and houses a couple dozens of workers. It doubles as a tavern/inn for peasantry.

***Gift House of Avandra.*** A huge, circular building in the market ward, made of marble with a peristyle dedicated to gambling, drugs, and prostitution. Holy symbols of Avandra are spread throughout.

***Merchant's Den.*** An arcaded bazaar that operates beneath the guild hall in the market ward.

***High Court of Theneta.*** A large alabaster courthouse in the royal ward where all criminal judgements take place. There are a host of noble judges but additionally, there is an annual judgement from a Sphinx known as Theneta that takes place for more sensitive cases.
