# Dreadnaughts

***Motto.*** "Long live Alrinh."

***Beliefs.*** The beliefs of the dreadnaughts can be summarized as follows:
- We are sword and shield of the Grand Duke, and nothing more.
- Heroism begets the perversion of orders, avoid it at all costs.
- As the height of Alrinhian prowess, failure can not be tolerated.

***Goals.*** Gather information throughout Alrinh, and closely monitor the actions of the Urogan. Open action should be avoided at all costs. Obey the words of the Grand Duke, and nobody else.

***Typical Quests.*** Typical dreadnaught quests include infiltrating an Urogan settlement to assassinate an enemy commander, secure a tactically advantageous outpost, or test a local militia to see if they can defend themselves when the time comes.

***Leader.*** [[Ash Ukria]], a grizzled human man.
