# Shar
###### Shar, the ringed city — capital of the Great Alrinhian Duchy.

Shar is a city of humility. People with wealth don't often show it, and even the poorest can find accomodations here. Shops are less common than market stands. The city is ripe with symbols and good omens of Pelor, as almost everyone here is an avid worshipper of the deity. There is typically a relaxed nature, and people rarely make a scene.
