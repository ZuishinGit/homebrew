# 1. Tomb Entrance
> As you wade through murky waters, the long, drooping trees give way to ruinous structures of stone that have sunken into the swamp. You can see the tops of crumbling stone archways and walls which are overgrown with thick vines. The surface weeds have clustered thickly around the structures and it looks difficult to move through.
>
> There is a central structure that looks mostly intact with a huge granite door at the front of the landing. It looks like there are words carved in the door.

Two **giant crocodiles** lurk beneath the leech-infested waters and will attack boats and other creatures if they approach the ruins. Spotting the crocodiles takes a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

The tomb's entrance is sealed and the only way to open it is to solve the door's puzzle.

***Dread Leeches.*** The water is infested with dread leeches, which attach themselves to any creatures of flesh and blood. An infested creature loses 2d8 hit points at the start of each of their turns, and has their hit points maximum reduced by the same amount until they complete a long rest. A creature can use an action to remove the leeches.

***Door Puzzle.*** Several words are embossed on the granite stonework, only few of which are readable:
> "... FROM AGES PAST AND ..."

The full verse once read:
> " HITHER LIE THE BOZIK LINE, OUR LEADERS FROM AGES PAST AND DIVINES FOREVERMORE"

but the words have since degraded.

Upon close inspection it seems the letters A G E S P A S (from the words AGES PAST) can be pressed like buttons, each yielding a satisfying click. Pressed in the right order — P A S S A G E — the granite doorway begins to grind and sink into the floor, letting out a cacophony of hundreds of moaning souls, and revealing a dark, sloping descent.

***Sloping Descent.*** The hall descends for 150 feet, ending at a circular door with runes inscribed in the doorway. Employ the Sphere of Crushing Doom trap from XGE when a creature interacts with the door.

# 2. Hall of Dead Servitors
The ramp ends at a circular doorway, opening into a hall. The length of the hall is flanked by two long charnel pits filled with humanoid bones. Suspended by two large caryatids is an ivory bell. Past the bell is a wooden door, banded with iron.

The whole chamber is in disrepair, the walls are cracked, the air is stale, and the alcoves are filled with candle-stubs and cobwebs.

***Ivory Bell.*** A creature attempting to ring the bell using anything but the sexton's scepter causes the creature to be possessed (no save). The creature can attempt a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw at advantage whenever they take damage, ending the effect on themselves on a success. Living inside the bell is a friendly spider.

# 3. Basking Room
This chamber has a domed ceiling, at the center of it is a large, marble statue of an angelic figure, with a halo and two feathered wings. The eyes give off a dim glow. The floor is made up of a beautiful mosaic that looks like a large, colourful arcane circle. There are two exits from this room, to the north and east. The southern pass is blocked by an illusory wall.

***Illusory Wall.*** The wall can only be perceived by magical means.

***Radiant Angel.*** When the characters approach one of the exits, the angel asks them something in celestial.

# 4. Gallery
This chamber is a gallery, with eerily lifelike statues. Suspended from the ceiling is a skeletal dragon. In actuality it is a **dragonbone golem**. If a fight breaks out here, two minotaur skeletons animate and join in. On the southern wall, a door.

Elsewhere in the room are inanimate wax sculptures depicting the five fingers of Bozik. They are: Barithiel, Abraxos, Nuriel, Sophiel, and Osmodiel.
They are all clad in similar armor with heraldry reminiscent of the Urogan.

# 5. Hall of the Judged
This chamber opens up into a natural cavern. At the center of the cavern is a large, subterranean lake that is decorated with dozens of statues of angels. In actuality, these are petrified celestials. One of which is the messenger that brought Roondar to the tomb. Lurking in the cave are four **chuul** that have grown attracted to the magic. The chamber is also full of will-o-wisps.

# 6. Bozik Legend

This vaulted chamber is covered wall to ceiling with magnificent frescoes that depict a swathe of monsters bowing down to a central figure against a backdrop of a misty tsunami. The central figure wears beautiful white armor with golden filigree. The helmet's visor is made to look like a grove of trees. He carries a banner with the following symbol:
![[Pasted image 20211126203732.png]]

There is a large stone door to the north with no perceivable handles. The face of the door is covered by a bas relief of a bearded man that wears robes and wields a staff. His beard curls up and forms four distinct swirls. Each of these swirls has a rune at its center. There are words inscribed on the top of the door:

> TO REJECT — TO DOMINATE — TO PRESERVE — TO SEE

***Door Puzzle.*** The door does not open and is warded magically. It can't be dispelled and it is immune to all damage. If attempts to force it open are made, then the room begins to flood with a mind-altering, magical mist from the frescoes (see Enchanted Frescoes).

***Solution.*** Each of the runes corresponds to a school of magic, hinted to by the words. A spell of the respective school must be cast, and as it does it begins to glow affirmingly. The correct order is: Abjuration — Enchantment — Necromancy — Divination, upon success the door disappears in a shimmer.

***Hints.*** Several hints can be applied if the party is slowing down:
- DC 15 Arcana — One of the glyphs are recognizable as an archaic depiction of the Necromancy school of magic.
- DC 15 History — The figure depicted on the door is a famed wizard who is said to have mastered all schools of magic.
- DC 25 Perception/Investigation — There is another rune cleverly hidden in the relief sculpture's beard. Anyone proficient in arcana can recognize that the rune seems to keep the door closed. If the rune is broken the door crumbles. This still activates the enchanted frescoes, but it allows the characters to advance.

***Enchanted Frescoe.*** A creature that looks carefully at the frescoe notices that the misty tsunami seems almost to move, possibly hinting at its magical quality. If anyone attempts to force open the door by any means, the room is bombarded by a blast of magical dust. Anyone in the area must succeed a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be covered by this magic dust. While covered, a creature is affected as if they had a faerie fire spell cast upon them, and their proficiency bonus is reduced by 1 (until they finish a long rest) every hour that it is on them. The dust can only be removed by water or by creative means.

# 7. The Bozik Ark
The central alabaster pillar in this room is carved to look like a large ship. The ground looks like waves lapping at the sides of the pillar. There are several funerary urns decorated with angelic scenes.

***Urns.*** These sealed urns contain the souls of the Divine Hand of Bozik. There are 5 in total. If they are destroyed or opened, the souls escape in a radiant explosion. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) radiant damage on a failure or half as much on a success. The first time an urn is destroyed, 3 ghosts are released in the chamber.

# 8. Treasures of Bozik
This room is a vault that contains the treasure of the Bozik lineage. The center of the room is dominated by the skull king, who clutches a scepter in one hand and a large tome in the other.
