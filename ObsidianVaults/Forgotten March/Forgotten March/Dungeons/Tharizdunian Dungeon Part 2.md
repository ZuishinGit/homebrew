# Tharizdunian Dungeon

Deep below the hollow obelisk at the center of Ai-Kazan lies this death trap of a dungeon. The dungeon was created by a netherese human known as Zhavasu. In life, he was a powerful wizard and head cultist of Tharizdun.

Zhavasu had this dungeon constructed long ago, intending for it to be a base of operations for his rising cult. Eventually, in an attempt to bring forth an avatar of Tharizdun, the cult had performed a mass ritualistic sacrifice. They did not realize it at the time, but the ritual had failed and instead an Atropal had formed.

Believing they had brought an incarnation of Tharizdun into the material plane, the cult worked to nourish the abomination, offering their own souls. As the cult's numbers dwindled, Zhavasu worked towards making the dungeon largely automated by magical constructs. He believed it was a matter of time before he himself expired, and nobody would be left to care for the atropal. It was this belief that caused him to design the death trap; so that those who enter this dungeon may die and have their soul be consumed by the atropal.

###### The Children of Etridhi

The cult known as the Children of Etridhi was dedicated to the domineering of primordial power, a mission originally sought by Tharizdun. They acknowledged primordials as the "sleeping gods". It was their goal to rouse one particular primordial from her slumber— Etridhi, the Rebirther.

# General Features

***Doors.*** By default, doors weigh 500 lbs. and can be lifted from the ground as an action, sliding up into a niche above them. Creatures with less than 20 strength can't lift the doors. (AC 20, HP 26, DC 22)

***Illumination.*** All chambers are unlit unless otherwise stated.

***Chamber Height.*** The height of a chamber is generally as high as its shortest continuous side.

# 0. Spherical Vestibule
> The eldritch script reads "*Rise, Etridhi, and quell the world's mewling.*"

# 1. Pool of Returning
> The chamber is dark and cold, but it smells sweet.
> 
> The floor of this long chamber is filled with a 2-feet-deep shimmering pink fluid. Lying in the this pool are 15 human bodies curled up in fetal position. You can see a door on the opposite end of the chamber.

***Western Door.*** The back wall is realistically painted in such a way that it looks like a door to any creature farther than 5 feet from the wall. A creature that can see the wall can use its action to discern its true nature with a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

***Pool.*** The pool is viscous and requires a creature use 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot moved. It is warm and strangely comforting. A creature can breathe normally in this fluid even while fully submerged. If a creature enters the pool, nothing happens until a creature reaches the "door" on the back wall. 

When this happens, any creatures in the pool feel a wave of extraordinary comfort wash over them, and they must succeed a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone and become stunned. Also on a failure, a creature's Wisdom score is reduced by 1d4 until they are targeted by a remove curse or greater restoration spell. A stunned creature must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. (The Wisdom score threshold for automatic failure is 5)

# 2. Statues of Zhavasu

>In the southern alcove of this hall is a life-size statue made of dark, greasy stone depicting a human with long, straight hair wearing a bejewelled headband. He dons thick robes and carries a staff in one hand, and a large grimoire in the other. The grimoire has a large spiral carved into the front of it. One thing you notice about the statue is it is missing ears.
>
>The statue is on a raised dais that has the words "Progenitor Zhavasu" carved into it. Also carved into the pedestal are six small faces of varying ancestry.

###### Investigating the faces:

>The faces, from left to right depict the following ancestries: a dwarf, a man, an elf, a halfling, a woman, and a dragonborn. Strangely enough they are all very life-like though they are all missing their ears. You notice that they look like they can be pressed, like buttons. 

***Statue Solution.*** The faces are indeed buttons, and when pressed in the right order, an *Alchemy Jug* appears at the base of the statue. 

The correct order is as follows:

1. Dragonborn
2. Human (Man)
3. Human (Woman)
4. Halfling
5. Dwarf (Hill)
6. Elf (Wood)

If the wrong order is pressed, the creature pressing the buttons must succeed a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be magically compelled — as if by the Geas spell — to read books when the opportunity presents itself. The statue's buttons then lock for 30 days, as a glowing message appears in the stone which reads: "*Zhavasu, you must study our history before trying again*".

# 3. Altar Room

>This sterile room smells metallic and has two levels to it. The top level is a simple balcony that overlooks the central atrium. There are two exits — one on the bottom floor going eastward, and another on the upper level going northward.
>
>An oversized, copper censer hangs from the ceiling.
>
>Dominating the room is an ornate shrine carved from white marble. Laid on top of the shrine is a silk cloth with golden embroidery, and on top of that are three candlesticks. The rightmost two are lit.
>
>You also see two sets of gleaming copper armor set upon pedestals flanking the shrine, these identical armor stands grip swords pointed downwards.

***Shrine.*** The shrine is surrounded by an Antilife Shell — preventing creatures from touching it. If a creature lights the third candle, the armor sets animate and attack. Extinguishing all three candles causes the shrine to give way to a secret tomb (see: Nursery).

***Electrified Armor.*** An investigation of the armor reveals that they are freestanding, and hollow. A DC 15 Perception check reveals scorch marks on the ceiling above each pedestal. 

As long as they are on the pedestals, the armor is electrified. Anyone touching an electrified set of armor takes 15 (6d4) lightning damage and must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed. While paralyzed, a creature can't let go of the armor, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of their turns. On a failed save, the creature takes the lightning damage again, and on a success the creature is able to release their grasp if they wish.

***Treasure.*** The cloth is worth 100 gp. The candlesticks are worth 25 gp each. Each armor set is made of copper, along with their weapons. In the censer is a *Bag of Beans*.

# 4. Nursery

>The air in this room is stale, but it seems clean. The floor is tiled, and you see sarcophagi set into alcoves along the wall. The sarcophagi are made of stone and have curved supports like a rocking chair's legs. You hear a feint grinding of stone on stone and realize the rearmost sarcophagus is slowly rocking side to side.

###### Investigating the sarcophagi:

>Engraved onto each sarcophagus is a large roman numeral, with the exception of the one in the western alcove.

***Sarcophagi.*** All sarcophagi have the preserved remains of long-dead incarnations of Zhavasu, buried along with their belongings, with the exception of the western one which belongs to Zhavasu.

The remains of the following ancestries can be found in each sarcophagus:

1. Dragonborn
2. Human (Man)
3. Human (Woman)
4. Halfling
5. Dwarf (Hill)
6. Elf (Wood)

This is the clue to solving Zhavasu's puzzle in Area 2.

***Zhavasu's Sarcophagus.*** Inside Zhavasu's sarcophagus is a screaming fetish, along with his spellbook, and an item from Magic Item Table E.

***Treasure.*** Each sarcophagus contains 500 gp worth of fine robes and jewelry.

# 5. Arcane Chamber
### 5a. Teleportation Circle

> This section of the room is dedicated to a permanent teleportation circle which has its glyphs stained into the floor.
> Ahead of that appears to be an illuminated study.

### 5b. Library

> This chamber has a round desk set into the northern alcove, which is surrounded by bookshelves that line the walls. There are thousands of books and journals in this study, most of which show some evidence of wear & tear on them. 
> 
> Laid out on the desk are a series of inked notes, illuminated by a glassy sphere that is set into the center of the desk.
>
> You are not alone in this study. Standing off to one side is a silent figure standing straight and extremely still. They are draped head-to-toe in ornate robes, and do not seem to pay attention to you.
> 
> ![Library magen|150](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Dark-Souls/Painting_Guardian_Set_equipx.jpg)

###### Reading the Notes

> The notes appear to be a personal recollection, separated into 7 distinct volumes.
> 
> The first of which appears to be a guidebook written by a man called Zhavasu. The notes seem to be reminders or instructions that he has written to himself. They are oddly basic in nature — common things like hygienic routines, or how to conduct oneself in a social setting.
>
> It appears that ink has spilled across the other volumes, making most of it unreadable. What remains of the notes seems to be a collection of writings by Zhavasu, though they all have different handwriting. These are not guidebooks and instead seem to be diaries. The last bits of parchment seem to recall moments of great regret and a creation that is described as Zhavasu's "greatest failure".

***Robed Inhabitant.*** The creature standing in the room is a magically constructed servant and will carry out any instructions here to the best of their abilities. They do not understand spoken language and must be written to. They have the statistics of a **hypnos magen**. 

***Treasure.*** Tucked in the shelves in scroll tubes are two magical scrolls: A *Scroll of Griffon Summoning*, and a *Scroll of Life Transference (3rd-level)*, findable with a DC 20 (Intelligence) Investigation check, or with a detect magic spell.

# 6. Tharizdun's Manifestation 

![Depiction of Tharizdun's Manifestation|300](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-frwin7LzLv0/TqGl3klZJNI/AAAAAAAADn4/wPvyYnE4FxM/s0/tharizdun.jpg)

> Another greasy black statue, this time depicting a mass of writhing tentacles protruding from a perfectly spherical orb. The orb is raised up from the ground, supported by the tentacles, but it is crafted to look like its floating.
>
> Circling the base of the statue are a series of eldritch inscriptions that have no meaning to you.

***Touching the Statue.*** When a creature touches the statue, they must succeed a DC 20 Strength saving throw or become restrained as they are slowly pulled into the mass of the statue. The creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming completely swallowed by the statue on a failure, or freeing themselves on a success.

A creature who is swallowed by the statue appears as one of the bodies in Area 1, lying unconscious in the pool. Only a greater restoration spell or stronger can end this effect.

Pass or fail, a creature that touches the statue can now read the eldritch inscriptions, which read:

>"*Through alms of Tharizdun may we provide succor to our mother of chaos.*"

***Destroying the Statue.*** The statue is a large object (18 AC; 45 HP). Whenever the statue takes damage, it releases a wave of energy in a 30-foot radius. Any creatures in the area must succeed a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw, taking 19 (3d12) psychic damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. When the statue is destroyed, it releases all of the items it has consumed over centuries: a *Dwarven Thrower*, a *Ring of Invisibility*, a *Cloak of Protection*, and a *Figurine of Wondrous Power (Silver Raven)*.

# 7. Sacrificial Chambers
> As you enter the dark chamber, the familiar wail of a baby is heard. The chamber has two levels, and has passageways on the east and west which are separated by a large pit. The borders of the pit on east and west are large dividers, while the north and south are precarious ledges with no rails. There are thin columns that stretch from the pit up to the ceiling.
>
> The bottom level of the chamber has a similar layout, though it lacks an eastern passage and has a protruding ledge on the east and west.

# 8. Shrine to Etridhi

> Dominating this small room is a statue depicting a colossal, bipedal woman with three arms. Her figure is gaunt and lanky, and her skin is stretched thin over her skeletal body. She has a distended stomach characteristic of someone pregnant. Her extremely long arms end in horrific claws and she is covered in bodies of other creatures who look like they are clinging onto her desperately. Covering her face is a large, featureless mask which looks like its emanating wispy tendrils.
> 
> Lying on the floor, at the base of the statue is the body of a young human boy, dressed in ornate white robes with the symbol of Tharizdun woven into them, wearing assorted jewelry. His head is bandaged, and at his side is a wax tablet and a stylus. He appears to be asleep.
>
> The alcoves around the room hold few things of note — the eastern alcove holds a large trunk, the north holds a small counter and chair, and the southernmost has a small, comfortable-looking bed and a staff leaning against it.

###### Investigating the staff:

> The staff is made of a dark wood with a reflective finish, and has many tiny cracks that have been filled with a gleaming electrum.

***Staff.*** The staff is an *[[Efreeti Staff]]*.

***Sleeping Boy.*** The sleeping boy is the seventh incarnation of Zhavasu. He wears a *Ring of Telekinesis*, and is currently attuned to his *Grimoire of Rebirth*, which is in his trunk, and the staff in the alcove. 

***Trunk.*** In the trunk are Zhavasu's private affections: An *Ioun Stone of Intellect*, a set of *Studded Leather armor of Cold Resistance*, a *Wand of the War Mage, +3* and a gold music box (2500 gp).
