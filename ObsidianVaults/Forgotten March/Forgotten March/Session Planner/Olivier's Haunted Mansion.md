## General Features

***Ringing Ears.*** Tinnitus plagues characters in the mansion. Hearing based Wisdom (Perception) checks have disadvantage, and every hour a creature that is not deafened must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion. The DC increases for every hour the characters hear the ringing. When a creature reaches more than 3 levels of exhaustion in this way, they are compelled to take an action to destroy their eardrums to stop the ringing, taking 55 (10d10) nonlethal piercing damage and becoming deafened in the process.
