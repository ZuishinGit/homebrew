# Unstable Rock

###### DC 15

A creature in the triggering area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage.

Fail by 5: A creature instead takes maximum damage and is buried under rubble. While buried, the creature is blinded restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the rubble, and is at risk of suffocating. A creature can take an action to make a DC 20 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.
