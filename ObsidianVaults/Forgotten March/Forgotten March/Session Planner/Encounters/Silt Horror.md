# Silt Horror

Type: Combat
Difficulty: Deadly
Environment: Wilderness

> There appears to be some kind of disturbance a mile out. A large cloud of sand has gathered. It doesn't look like a sandstorm — more like there was some kind of large disturbance. The sand is slowly dispersing.

###### The party approaches territory

> The sand feels softer here, as if the ground was recently disturbed. You see the remains of some kind of wooden boat that has been torn in two. There is a scene of viscera — body parts, blood-stained sand and belongings.

###### If they keep going

> The sand begins to shift, and you feel tremors beneath the ground. Immediately, four massive tentacle-like appendages burst forth from beneath and go straight for you.

###### Bonus Encounter

> While searching the rubble, you hear a coughing sound followed by a voice — "Help, I'm trapped! Please help me"

The voice belongs to Mushad, a half-orc that was recently recruited by the Gale Kings from Ghul's Landing. He is pinned underneath wooden debris from the attack. His leg is missing, and he can only hobble on one leg. If questioned, he tells the characters they were pursuing a tresspasser spotted in the area.
