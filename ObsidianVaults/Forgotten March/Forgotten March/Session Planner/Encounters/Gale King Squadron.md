# Gale King Squadron

Type: Social
Environment: Wilderness

> Particles of sand around you begin to rise slightly — and you spot a Gale King troupe 90 feet away. There are 5 people in total. 3 of them look like simple thugs, one of them seems to be unarmed and carries an ornate flute and a ton of jewelry, the last one wears a strange silvery helmet that covers his entire face and he actually appears to be hovering a few inches off the ground as he glides across the sands towards you. He shouts out towards you, "Travelers, we wish for you to accompany us to our domain for there are talks of recruitment to be had. Refusal will beget your destruction."

##### Roster:
- Gale King Master \[wearing a *Helm of Teleportation*]
- Bard
- Gale King Thug (3)

##### Treasure:

The master dons a *Helm of Teleportation*, but nothing else. The bard's flute is worth 100 gp, and he wears a large gold bracelet (250 gp), and a silver necklace with a gemstone pendant (250 gp). In total, they have 1,500 sp and 50 pp amongst them in coinage.

###### Accepting Raisan's Invitation

If the party accepts their request for accompaniement, the Master will cast Teleport from the helmet, targeting his meditation chamber in Al-Azid's Ghostly Palace.

> The air shimmers around you and for a moment a flash of light blinds you. As your vision adjusts, you realize your environment has changed completely. You are now in a candle-lit chamber, 15 x 30 feet, and 10 feet high. The walls are painted with an assortment of highly detailed mandalas. The ceiling is a beautiful array of painted alcoves that almost resemble a honeycomb. The smell of incense is very strong in this room.
> 
> On either side of you, set into the shorter walls of the room are two doorways that are simply curtained off.
> 
> All of you appear to be seated on meditation ornate cushions laid upon checkered stone floors. Including the helmetted man, who addresses you now:
> 
> "I'm glad you've come peacefully. I'm aware of your power, and I can sense the presence of great magic on your person. I would like to offer you employ under me as a fellow Gale King. We will pay you all handsomely, and you will have all of the amenities of this palace at your disposal. There is a non-negotiable term of this deal though — you must surrender the nether scroll of Azumar to me personally."

At this point, if the characters decline, the master will offer a trade. A *Staff of Thunder and Lightning*, a *Tome of Understanding* (its power returns in 60 days), a *Pearl of Power*, and a wealth of gemstones worth 12,000 gp, and the offer to leave without harm.
