# Chathrang Herd

Type: Combat
Difficulty: Medium
Environment: Wilderness

> In the distance, you see three green tortoises the size of horses. Their large shells have an array of spines protruding from them, and you can see a strange secretion dripping from them. Between the three of these creatures you see a much smaller one, that walks awkwardly. They pay no attention to you as they walk away.

###### Closer Look: DC 16

> You see a small shard of metal stuck in the eye of one of the tortoise-like creatures.

Roster:

- Chathrang (3)
- Juvenile Chathrang (1) \[noncombatant]

Treasure: One of the chathrangs has a shard of metal stuck in its eye. It is an *Outer Essence Shard (Lawful)*.
