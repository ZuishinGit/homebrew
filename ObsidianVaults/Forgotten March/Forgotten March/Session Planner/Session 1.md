# Session Outline
> Last we left off, you guys were investigating the disappearance of an elven journalist who you believed to be related to the assassination attempt. Your investigation lead you through the sewers to an abandoned riverside mill, which was used to press wine.
> 
> You found a number of dubious little creatures in the mill — assassins, thugs, and even a wizard — but you also found a man half-beaten, who is currently unconscious.
> 
> A few things to bring  you into the world at large:
> - The Dawnhood oracles have determined that the catastrophe will occur within 1 months time. Specifically, there are 24 days left.
> - Magnus discerned that the next piece of the rod is likely in the territory of the Urogan.
> - Up until now, the Duchy and the Theocracy have had a truce, but the Grand Duke shared his suspicion that this assassination attempt marks the breaking of that truce, and it will likely escalate now.
>
> On the note of the assassination, you guys have three main clues that you might be able to use if you pursue this thread.
> 1. The strangely shaped dagger.
> 2. The relation to Zehir, which you know to be the god of darkness & poison.
> 3. Alphonse noted that the poison reminded him of the work of Vilberg — an infamous poisoner who has been locked in the dungeons under Alrinh.
>
> Now that thats out of the way, we come back to the characters, who are in the middle of investigating the mill. You look around the dusty building illuminated by oil lamps, and the smell of blood is in the air. Two thugs survived your assault, one had made their escape. The other one is in terrible condition, his broken limbs can attest to that. Where do you go from here?
