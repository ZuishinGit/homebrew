# Olivier's Haunted Mansion

***Reflections of Failure.*** The mansion is haunted by the dark emotions of Zhavasu and he perceives as his greatest failure. A manifestation of Zhavasu's dread

## General Features

***Ringing Ears.*** Tinnitus plagues characters in the mansion. Hearing based Wisdom (Perception) checks have disadvantage, and every hour a creature that is not deafened must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion. The DC increases for every hour the characters hear the ringing. When a creature reaches more than 3 levels of exhaustion in this way, they are compelled to take an action to destroy their eardrums to stop the ringing, taking 55 (10d10) nonlethal piercing damage and becoming deafened in the process.

## Encounters

***Apocryphal Painting.*** A painting shows the characters corpses.

***Flooding Room.*** The room locks and begins to flood with black water from a painting. Roll for initiative. The room is difficult terrain, and a creature must use an action to break the door down (DC 17; AC 16; HP 20).

***A Crack Beyond.*** A character hears scratching against the wood. Upon looking, they see a bloodshot eye glaring back at them through a crack in the wood. Anyone who looks at the crack is subject to the death gaze of a bodak.

***Phantasmal Killer.*** A character has a vision of ritualistic sacrifice to the atropal. They are subject to the Phantasmal Killer spell (DC 20)

***Ghostly Possession.*** When a creature is alone in the mansion, a ghost appears from the Ethereal plane and attempts to possess them. Roll a d6 to determine the spirit's identity:

1d10|Spirit
-|-
1|One of Zhavasu's forms
2-9|Tharizdun cultist
10|Netherese sacrifice

***Frosted Window.*** The characters hear a soft squeaking noise, as a nearby frosted over window are the words "forgive my failure", written repeatedly.

***Dread of Zhavasu.*** The characters come across the babbling visage of Zhavasu, who whispers maddening incantations of self-loathing.
