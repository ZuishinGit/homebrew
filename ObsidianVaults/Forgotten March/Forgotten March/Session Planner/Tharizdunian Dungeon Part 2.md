# Tharizdunian Dungeon

Deep below the hollow obelisk at the center of Ai-Kazan lies this death trap of a dungeon. The dungeon was created by a netherese human known as Zhavasu. In life, he was a powerful wizard and head cultist of Tharizdun.

Zhavasu had this dungeon constructed long ago, intending for it to be a base of operations for his rising cult. Eventually, in an attempt to bring forth an avatar of Tharizdun, the cult had performed a mass ritualistic sacrifice. They did not realize it at the time, but the ritual had failed and instead an Atropal had formed.

Believing they had brought an incarnation of Tharizdun into the material plane, the cult worked to nourish the abomination, many offering their own souls as nourishment. As the cult's numbers dwindled, Zhavasu worked towards making the dungeon largely automated by magical constructs. He believed it was a matter of time before he himself expired, and nobody would be left to care for the atropal. It was this belief that caused him to design the death trap; so that those who enter this dungeon may die and have their soul be consumed by the atropal.

# 1. Pool of Returning
> The chamber is dark and cold, but it smells sweet.
> 
> This floor of this long chamber is filled with a 2-feet-deep shimmering pink fluid. Lying in the this pool are 15 human bodies curled up in fetal position. You can see a door on the opposite end of the chamber.

***Door.*** The back wall is realistically painted in such a way that it looks like a door to any creature farther than 5 feet from the wall. A creature that can see the wall can use its action to discern its true nature with a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

***Pool.*** The pool is viscous and requires a creature use 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot moved. It is warm and strangely comforting. A creature can breathe normally in this fluid even while fully submerged. If a creature enters the pool, nothing happens until a creature reaches the "door" on the back wall. 

When this happens, any creatures in the pool feel a wave of extraordinary comfort wash over them, and they must succeed a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone and become stunned. Also on a failure, a creature's Wisdom score is reduced by 1d4 until they are targeted by a remove curse or greater restoration spell. A stunned creature must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. (The Wisdom score threshold for automatic failure is 5)

# 2. Statue of Zhavasu

>In the eastern alcove of this hall is a life-size statue made of dark, greasy stone depicting a human with long, straight hair wearing a bejewelled headband. He dons thick robes and carries a staff in one hand, and a large grimoire in the other. The grimoire has a large spiral carved into the front of it.
>
>The statue is on a raised pedestal that has the name Zhavasu carved into it.
