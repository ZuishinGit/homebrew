# Tharizdunian Dungeon

Deep below the hollow obelisk at the center of Ai-Kazan lies this death trap of a dungeon. The dungeon was created by a netherese human known as Zhavasu. In life, he was a powerful wizard and head cultist of Tharizdun.

Zhavasu had this dungeon constructed long ago, intending for it to be a base of operations for his rising cult. Eventually, in an attempt to bring forth an avatar of Tharizdun, the cult had performed a mass ritualistic sacrifice. They did not realize it at the time, but the ritual had failed and instead an Atropal had formed.

Believing they had brought an incarnation of Tharizdun into the material plane, the cult worked to nourish the abomination, offering their own souls. As the cult's numbers dwindled, Zhavasu worked towards making the dungeon largely automated by magical constructs. He believed it was a matter of time before he himself expired, and nobody would be left to care for the atropal. It was this belief that caused him to design the death trap; so that those who enter this dungeon may die and have their soul be consumed by the atropal.

# General Features

***Doors.*** By default, doors weigh 500 lbs. and can be lifted from the ground as an action, sliding up into a niche above them. Creatures with less than 20 strength can't lift the doors. (AC 20, HP 26, DC 22)

# 1. Pool of Returning
> The chamber is dark and cold, but it smells sweet.
> 
> The floor of this long chamber is filled with a 2-feet-deep shimmering pink fluid. Lying in the this pool are 15 human bodies curled up in fetal position. You can see a door on the opposite end of the chamber.

***Western Door.*** The back wall is realistically painted in such a way that it looks like a door to any creature farther than 5 feet from the wall. A creature that can see the wall can use its action to discern its true nature with a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

***Pool.*** The pool is viscous and requires a creature use 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot moved. It is warm and strangely comforting. A creature can breathe normally in this fluid even while fully submerged. If a creature enters the pool, nothing happens until a creature reaches the "door" on the back wall. 

When this happens, any creatures in the pool feel a wave of extraordinary comfort wash over them, and they must succeed a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone and become stunned. Also on a failure, a creature's Wisdom score is reduced by 1d4 until they are targeted by a remove curse or greater restoration spell. A stunned creature must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. (The Wisdom score threshold for automatic failure is 5)

# 2. Statues of Zhavasu

>In the southern alcove of this hall is a life-size statue made of dark, greasy stone depicting a human with long, straight hair wearing a bejewelled headband. He dons thick robes and carries a staff in one hand, and a large grimoire in the other. The grimoire has a large spiral carved into the front of it. One thing you notice about the statue is it is missing ears.
>
>The statue is on a raised pedestal that has the words "Progenitor Zhavasu" carved into it. Also carved into the pedestal are six small faces of varying ancestry.

###### Investigating the faces:

>The faces, from left to right depict the following ancestries: a dwarf, a man, an elf, a halfling, a woman, and a dragonborn. Strangely enough they are all very life-like though they are all missing their ears. You notice that they look like they can be pressed, like buttons. 

***Statue.*** The statue depicts the original Zhavasu, along with his book. The six faces in the pedestal are his six incarnations in the following order:

The faces are indeed buttons, and when pressed in the right order, a 

1. Dragonborn
2. Human
3. Human
4. Halfling
5. Dwarf (Hill)
6. Elf (Wood)

# 3. Altar Room

>This sterile room smells kind of metallic and has two levels to it. The top level is a simple balcony that overlooks the central atrium. There are two exits — one on the bottom floor going eastward, and another on the upper level going northward.
>
>An oversized, copper censer hangs from the ceiling.
>
>Dominating the room is an ornate shrine carved from white marble. Laid on top of the shrine is a silk cloth with golden embroidery, and on top of that are three candlesticks. The rightmost two are lit.
>
>You also see two sets of gleaming copper armor set upon pedestals flanking the shrine, these identical armor stands grip swords pointed downwards.

***Shrine.*** The shrine is surrounded by an Antilife Shell — preventing creatures from touching it. If a creature lights the third candle, the armor sets animate and attack. Extinguishing all three candles causes the shrine to give way to a secret tomb (see: Nursery).

***Electrified Armor.*** An investigation of the armor reveals that they are freestanding, and hollow. A DC 15 Perception check reveals scorch marks on the ceiling above each pedestal. 

As long as they are on the pedestals, the armor is electrified. Anyone touching an electrified set of armor takes 15 (6d4) lightning damage and must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed. While paralyzed, a creature can't let go of the armor, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of their turns. On a failed save, the creature takes the lightning damage again, and on a success the creature is able to release their grasp if they wish.

***Treasure.*** The cloth is worth 100 gp. The candlesticks are worth 25 gp each. Each armor set is made of copper, along with their weapons.

# 4. Nursery

>The air in this room is stale, but it seems clean. The floor is tiled, and you see sarcophagi set into alcoves along the wall. The sarcophagi are made of stone and have curved supports like a rocking chair's legs. You hear a feint grinding of stone on stone and realize the rearmost sarcophagus is slowly rocking side to side.

###### Investigating the sarcophagi:

>Engraved onto each sarcophagus is a large roman numeral, with the exception of the one in the western alcove.

***Sarcophagi.*** All sarcophagi have the preserved remains of long-dead incarnations of Zhavasu, buried along with their belongings, with the exception of the western one which belongs to Zhavasu.

The remains of the following ancestries can be found in each sarcophagus:

1. Dragonborn
2. Human (Man)
3. Human (Woman)
4. Halfling
5. Dwarf (Hill)
6. Elf (Wood)

This is the clue to solving Zhavasu's puzzle in area 2.

***Zhavasu's Sarcophagus.*** Inside Zhavasu's sarcophagus is a screaming fetish, along with his spellbook, and an item from Magic Item Table E.

***Treasure.***
