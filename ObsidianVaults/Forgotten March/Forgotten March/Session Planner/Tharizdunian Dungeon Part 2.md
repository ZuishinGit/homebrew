# Tharizdunian Dungeon

Deep below the hollow obelisk at the center of Ai-Kazan lies this death trap of a dungeon. The dungeon was created by a netherese human known as Zhavasu. In life, he was a powerful wizard and head cultist of Tharizdun.

Zhavasu had this dungeon constructed long ago, intending for it to be a base of operations for his rising cult. Eventually, in an attempt to bring forth an avatar of Tharizdun, the cult had performed a mass ritualistic sacrifice. They did not realize it at the time, but the ritual had failed and instead an Atropal had formed.

Believing they had brought an incarnation of Tharizdun into the material plane, the cult worked to nourish the abomination, offering their own souls. As the cult's numbers dwindled, Zhavasu worked towards making the dungeon largely automated by magical constructs. He believed it was a matter of time before he himself expired, and nobody would be left to care for the atropal. It was this belief that caused him to design the death trap; so that those who enter this dungeon may die and have their soul be consumed by the atropal.

# General Features

***Doors.*** By default, doors weigh 500 lbs. and can be lifted from the ground as an action, sliding up into a niche above them. Creatures with less than 20 strength can't lift the doors. (AC 20, HP 26, DC 22)

# 1. Pool of Returning
> The chamber is dark and cold, but it smells sweet.
> 
> The floor of this long chamber is filled with a 2-feet-deep shimmering pink fluid. Lying in the this pool are 15 human bodies curled up in fetal position. You can see a door on the opposite end of the chamber.

***Western Door.*** The back wall is realistically painted in such a way that it looks like a door to any creature farther than 5 feet from the wall. A creature that can see the wall can use its action to discern its true nature with a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

***Pool.*** The pool is viscous and requires a creature use 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot moved. It is warm and strangely comforting. A creature can breathe normally in this fluid even while fully submerged. If a creature enters the pool, nothing happens until a creature reaches the "door" on the back wall. 

When this happens, any creatures in the pool feel a wave of extraordinary comfort wash over them, and they must succeed a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone and become stunned. Also on a failure, a creature's Wisdom score is reduced by 1d4 until they are targeted by a remove curse or greater restoration spell. A stunned creature must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. (The Wisdom score threshold for automatic failure is 5)

# 2. Statues of Zhavasu

>In the southern alcove of this hall is a life-size statue made of dark, greasy stone depicting a human with long, straight hair wearing a bejewelled headband. He dons thick robes and carries a staff in one hand, and a large grimoire in the other. The grimoire has a large spiral carved into the front of it. One thing you notice about the statue is it is missing ears.
>
>The statue is on a raised dais that has the words "Progenitor Zhavasu" carved into it. Also carved into the pedestal are six small faces of varying ancestry.

###### Investigating the faces:

>The faces, from left to right depict the following ancestries: a dwarf, a man, an elf, a halfling, a woman, and a dragonborn. Strangely enough they are all very life-like though they are all missing their ears. You notice that they look like they can be pressed, like buttons. 

***Statue.*** The statue depicts the original Zhavasu, along with his book. The six faces in the pedestal are his six incarnations in the following order:

The faces are indeed buttons, and when pressed in the right order, a 

1. Dragonborn
2. Human
3. Human
4. Halfling
5. Dwarf (Hill)
6. Elf (Wood)

# 3. Altar Room

>This sterile room smells kind of metallic and has two levels to it. The top level is a simple balcony that overlooks the central atrium. There are two exits — one on the bottom floor going eastward, and another on the upper level going northward.
>
>An oversized, copper censer hangs from the ceiling.
>
>Dominating the room is an ornate shrine carved from white marble. Laid on top of the shrine is a silk cloth with golden embroidery, and on top of that are three candlesticks. The rightmost two are lit.
>
>You also see two sets of gleaming copper armor set upon pedestals flanking the shrine, these identical armor stands grip swords pointed downwards.

***Shrine.*** The shrine is surrounded by an Antilife Shell — preventing creatures from touching it. If a creature lights the third candle, the armor sets animate and attack. Extinguishing all three candles causes the shrine to give way to a secret tomb (see: Nursery).

***Electrified Armor.*** An investigation of the armor reveals that they are freestanding, and hollow. A DC 15 Perception check reveals scorch marks on the ceiling above each pedestal. 

As long as they are on the pedestals, the armor is electrified. Anyone touching an electrified set of armor takes 15 (6d4) lightning damage and must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed. While paralyzed, a creature can't let go of the armor, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of their turns. On a failed save, the creature takes the lightning damage again, and on a success the creature is able to release their grasp if they wish.

***Treasure.*** The cloth is worth 100 gp. The candlesticks are worth 25 gp each. Each armor set is made of copper, along with their weapons. In the censer is a *Bag of Beans*.

# 4. Nursery

>The air in this room is stale, but it seems clean. The floor is tiled, and you see sarcophagi set into alcoves along the wall. The sarcophagi are made of stone and have curved supports like a rocking chair's legs. You hear a feint grinding of stone on stone and realize the rearmost sarcophagus is slowly rocking side to side.

###### Investigating the sarcophagi:

>Engraved onto each sarcophagus is a large roman numeral, with the exception of the one in the western alcove.

***Sarcophagi.*** All sarcophagi have the preserved remains of long-dead incarnations of Zhavasu, buried along with their belongings, with the exception of the western one which belongs to Zhavasu.

The remains of the following ancestries can be found in each sarcophagus:

1. Dragonborn
2. Human (Man)
3. Human (Woman)
4. Halfling
5. Dwarf (Hill)
6. Elf (Wood)

This is the clue to solving Zhavasu's puzzle in area 2.

***Zhavasu's Sarcophagus.*** Inside Zhavasu's sarcophagus is a screaming fetish, along with his spellbook, and an item from Magic Item Table E.

***Treasure.*** Each sarcophagus contains 500 gp worth of fine robes and jewelry.

# 5. Arcane Chamber
### 5a. Teleportation Circle

> This section of the room is dedicated to a permanent teleportation circle which has its glyphs stained into the floor.
> Ahead of that appears to be an illuminated study.

### 5b. Library

> This chamber has a round desk set into the northern alcove, which is surrounded by bookshelves that line the walls. There are thousands of books and journals in this study, most of which show some evidence of wear & tear on them. 
> Laid out on the desk are a series of inked notes, illuminated by a glassy sphere that is set into the center of the desk.

###### Reading the Notes

> The notes appear to be a personal recollection, separated into 7 distinct volumes.
> 
> The first appears to be a memoir written by a man called Zhavasu. He often refers to himself as the leader of a group called the Children of Etridhi. The last few notes seem to be reminders or instructions that he has written for himself. They are oddly basic in nature — common things like hygienic routines, or how to conduct oneself in a social setting.
>
> It appears that ink has spilled across the other volumes, making most of it unreadable. What remains of the notes seems to be a collection of writings by Zhavasu, though they all have different handwriting. These are not memoirs and instead seem to be diaries. The last bits of parchment seem to recall moments of great regret and a creation that is described as Zhavasu's "greatest failure".

# 6. Tharizdun's Manifestation

> Another greasy black statue, this time depicting a mass of writhing tentacles protruding from a perfectly spherical orb. The orb is raised up from the ground, supported by the tentacles, but it is crafted to look like its floating.
>
> Circling the base of the statue are a series of eldritch inscriptions that have no meaning to you.

***Touching the Statue.*** Any creature that touches the statue must succeed a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become cursed. While cursed, a creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws while the statue is out of their sight. 

Pass or fail, a creature that touches the statue can now read the eldritch inscriptions, which read:
>"*Channel power to the Chained God, so he can break his chains.*"

# 7. Sacrificial Chambers
> As you enter the dark chamber, the familiar wail of a baby is heard. The chamber has two levels, and has passageways on the east and west which are separated by a large pit. The borders of the pit on east and west are large dividers, while the north and south are precarious ledges with no rails. There are thin columns that stretch from the pit up to the ceiling.
>
> The bottom level of the chamber has a similar layout, though it lacks an eastern passage and has a protruding ledge on the east and west.


# 8. Shrine to Etridhi
