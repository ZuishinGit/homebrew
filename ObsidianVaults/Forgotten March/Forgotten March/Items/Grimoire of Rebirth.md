# Grimoire of Rebirth
When you die, your soul is reincarnated to a new body which appears in a safe place within 1 mile of where you died. If no such place exists, this reincarnation fails.

The new body takes a new race depending appropriate to where you died, or determined randomly as per the reincarnate spell, though the body is that of a newborn baby. The creature retains its memories, though is subject to normal mental development that is characteristic of the race.

***Curse.*** A creature reincarnated by this item is plagued by painful tinnitus, which pervades through all forms of their potential incarnations, and is preventable only by a wish spell. If the creature becomes deafened, they are relieved of the symptoms but the curse still lingers.
