As an abishai, Zedaar is subservient to Tiamat; however, in his vast power he has earned some liberties to do as he pleases. He was tasked with safeguarding [[Zikzokrishka|Zikzokrishka's]] phylactery with the intention of using it to control her, though the Knights of the March had destroyed it against Zedaar's will. The encounter with the Knights of the March left Zedaar wounded, though he escaped using his staff.
