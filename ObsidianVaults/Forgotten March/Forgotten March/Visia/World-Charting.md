## Alrinh

Alrinh, a continent of mystery which has not been fully explored and is relatively new in history. This is not true however, the continent merely has had a long dark age from 3 centuries prior.


## Ai-Kazan

Also known as the brightlands, this ancient desert island exists in an elemental conflux. As a result, it is permanently day. It is rumoured that the island's netherese inhabitants caused this chaotic confluence of elements and have perished shortly after. The desert island itself has a psychic quality that its inhabitants (including the flora and fauna) have adapted to and learned to utilize.


## Bafenzel

A magically constructed, square fortress that floats on the sea. The city is mobile, but rarely changes its location. It often acts as a trade hub between major continents, dealing in more dubious and magical goods. The wealthy rule there, and coin has more influence than any merit or deed. Anyone who is interested in commerce and other cultures has heard of this city.


## Lost Lagoon

A small island inhabited by kuo-toa who are working to complete their idol, Barnybellinaeus, a beholder-esque being. The island was once inhabited by dwarves of the sea who had used the island as a research base.


## Lurorum

Lurorum is a forested island where all gnomes hail from. It is very technologically advanced but keep most of their greatest achievements secret from the world.


## Nevania

A thick woodland island whose citizens are mostly viking-esque humans. They are watched closely by Alrinh but have historically raided any and all ships that pass by their territory. There is a great canal that passes through the Nevania strait, allowing an alternate albeit dangerous route for ocean-bound ships from Alrinh.
