# Framing Events

***Villain.*** There are two main villains: [[Velimir Bozik]] (and his divine lineage), and the "man behind the screen" is Fraz-Urb'luu, the demon lord of deceit.

***Henchmen (Minor Villains).*** [[Velimir Bozik]] has five commanders that make up the fingers of [[Bozik's Divine Hand]]. They are: [[Barithiel]], [[Abraxos]], [[Nuriel]], [[Sophiel]], and [[Osmodiel]].

###### Sideline Actors: Cabarin's Corrupted
***Sideline Villain.*** A **nagpa** named [[Cabarin]] has cloistered himself within the walls of [[Shar Overview|Shar]]. He acts as an accelerationist of the calamity, though he is not directly allied with the Urogan. His main motives lie in the fact that he is cursed such that he may only find lore in the ruins of civilization — and the sooner one happens, the better.

***Sideline Henchmen (Minor Villains).*** [[Cabarin]] only has one main henchwoman that he depends upon — a worshipper of Zehir who goes by the name of [[Eveus]].
