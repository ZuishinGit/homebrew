## Introduction
The adventure starts with the party's triumphant return to Shar, upon which a festival is prepared. It takes only one day to fully prepare for the festival, after which it commences on the dusk of the following day.

### Festival of the March

The agenda for the festival is as follows:

***First Period.*** A venue of bards and entertainers performing to get the spirits up. Bookended by announcements made in thanks of sponsors and gratitude to the knights.

***Second Period.*** A banquet for the attendees with music and conversation from noble families.

***Third Period.*** A commemorative marching through Shar, culminating with the erection of statues made in honor of the Knights.

## Inciting Incident: Attempt on the Grand Duke's Life

On the night of the festival, [[Norman Mocsudom]] returns to his chambers in the royal villa, where he is accosted by [[Eveus]]. The guards were called and Eveus had launched her attack. Protected by a blessing granted to him long ago, Norman survived the encounter, though the blessing is now spent and his life is in danger, as Eveus had escaped.

In response, Norman Mocsudom heightens security measures and notifies the party of the events transpired, and asks for their aid in catching the assassin:

> "I apologize for the sudden summons, but I believe this to be of utmost importance. I wish to inform you of an even that had transpired on the night of the festival."
>
> "After celebrations, when I had withdrawn to my chambers here in the villa, it seemed there was an assassin awaiting my arrival. Luckily the guards had come to my aid in time, causing them to flee."
> 
> "I survived by happenstance, but this assassin still remains at-large. We suspect this is the work of the Theocracy. Which, if true, means they may be trying to make a move, and one so close to the heart of the Duchy is... unacceptable."
>
> "In regard to catching the assassin, they have left a clue of their identity: they wielded a dagger that was shaped like a serpent. Such a crude weapon would only be used by those that worship Zehir."
>
> "Please keep an eye out for this would-be assassin. If this is the Theocracy, then your lives may be in danger too. You are hereby dismissed."

## Discovering the Assassin

There are three avenues of discovering the assassin's identity:
- Asking people
	- Citizens if they have seen someone suspicious
	- Smiths in the area if they have seen a dagger
	- Worshippers of Zehir

## Prynn Estate
### Cellar Level
#### 1. Wine Cellar
The north wall is stocked with 100 bottles of House Prynn wine (20 gp ea., 2000 gp total), and the south wall has three alcoves that contain barrels of the same wine. Each alcove has three stacked barrels. A single barrel of wine weighs 150 lbs and can be sold for 1000 gp.

***Secret Door.*** The central alcove has a false wall behind the barrels, which is discernable with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

#### 2. Guarded Hall
This hall is watched by two trained bowmen who stand behind arrow slits in area 4, providing them with 3/4 cover. They will fire at any unfamiliar creatures. One round after the bowmen fire, the thugs will enter the hall through a secret door.

Any noise made in this area attracts the attention of the creatures in areas 4 and 3.

***Secret Door.*** The flush wall can actually pivot, acting as a door. It requires a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the seam in the wall.

#### 3. Cabarin's Quarters
This ruinous bedchamber is occupied by the head guard of the Prynn estate. He is drafting a letter of resignation, which can be found on the dilapitated desk.

#### 4. Guard Station
The door to this chamber is barred from the inside. The chamber has 8 bunked beds and a host of weaponry and armor, all bearing the heraldry of House Prynn.

#### 5. Cross Hall
The walls of this hall are moist, and the air is dank. The chamber is dominated by a 20-foot-deep central atrium that is halfway filled with pristine water. The sound of rushing water can be heard coming from the northern exit.

#### 6. Trapped Sewer Entrance
The hall connects to the sewer system of Shar, and has a ladder that leads to a fake well just outside the walls of the Prynn estate. Rainwater trickles down the ladder into the sewer track.

***Trapped Bridge.*** There is a glyph of warding placed on the walkway to the ladder. It is nearly invisible, but can be noticed with a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. A creature that steps on it triggers the glyph and must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be polymorphed into The Lost for 1 minute or until their new form is reduced to 0 hit points.

#### 7. Cabarin's Court
This small chamber is filled with benches that look towards a raised, 5-foot-high platform. Standing on the platform is Cabarin and the head of house Prynn. To the side of Cabarin is a lever, and behind him against the western wall is a large replica of Shar. 

The pillars provide Cabarin half-cover. As soon as the characters enter, Cabarin pulls the lever, which drops the portcullis in front of the door.

***Adamantine Portcullis.*** A 5-foot section of the portcullis has 23 AC and 27 hit points, and can be bent with a DC 26 Strength (Athletics) check.

#### 8. Trapped Vault
This 10-foot-high hallway opens up into the Prynn family vault, containing some of their more valuable heirlooms. The entrance is trapped with a pressure plate, discernable with a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. When a creature steps on the pressure plate, nothing immediately happens. After 1 minute has passed, Initiative should be rolled as the ground in the hallway begins to rise towards the ceiling, blocking the entrance completely. On initiative count 20, and again on 10, the floor rises 2 feet.

***Statue.*** The glass statue depicts Tiamat, the goddess of wealth, greed, and vengeance. It is enchanted with a protective dweomer that prevents teleportation into and out of this area. If attacked, the statue animates into a glass hydra with resistance to piercing and slashing damage.

#### 5. Dining Room
Several padded chairs surround a large wooden table. There is a gold-plated candelabra with 3 lit *Candles of Everburning*. The western wall has an awakened, animated, mounted bear head that greets any characters when they enter. The bear head knows of Cabarin and that the Prynn family is being used, and asks them to put an end to the nagpa.

#### 6. Main Hall
Three guards patrol this hall. They will attempt to get reinforcements from area 8.

***Treasure.*** One of the guards has a large keyring with several iron keys. This contains the keys to all doors on the ground floor.

For the duration, the creature can speak with plants and animals.

***Secret Door.*** The bookshelf to the north is a secret door, operated by an invisible rope hanging from the ceiling above the desk. It requires a creature stand on the desk to pull. The draft coming from the north is noticeable with a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check.
