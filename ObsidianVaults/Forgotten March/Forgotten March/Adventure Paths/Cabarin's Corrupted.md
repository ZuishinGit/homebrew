# Adventure Path: Cabarin's Corrupted

Hidden away in the royal ward of [[Shar Overview|Shar]] is a group known as Cabarin's Corrupted. Lead by [[Cabarin]], a nagpa who wishes to accelerate the calamity that is predicted to befall the world by the next new moon. He is aided by a Zehir assassin named [[Eveus]], and a host of nobles that [[Cabarin]] himself has schmoozed over.

## Introduction
The adventure starts with the party's triumphant return to Shar, upon which a festival is prepared. It takes only one day to fully prepare for the festival, after which it commences on the dusk of the following day.

### Festival of the March

The agenda for the festival is as follows:

***First Period.*** A venue of bards and entertainers performing to get the spirits up. Bookended by announcements made in thanks of sponsors and gratitude to the knights.

***Second Period.*** A banquet for the attendees with music and conversation from noble families.

***Third Period.*** A commemorative marching through Shar, culminating with the erection of statues made in honor of the Knights.

## Inciting Incident: Attempt on the Grand Duke's Life

On the night of the festival, [[Norman Mocsudom]] returns to his chambers in the royal villa, where he is accosted by [[Eveus]]. The guards were called and Eveus had launched her attack. Protected by a blessing granted to him long ago, Norman survived the encounter, though the blessing is now spent and his life is in danger, as Eveus had escaped.

In response, Norman Mocsudom heightens security measures and notifies the party of the events transpired, and asks for their aid in catching the assassin:

> "I apologize for the sudden summons, but I believe this to be of utmost importance. I wish to inform you of an even that had transpired on the night of the festival."
>
> "After celebrations, when I had withdrawn to my chambers here in the villa, it seemed there was an assassin awaiting my arrival. Luckily the guards had come to my aid in time, causing them to flee."
> 
> "I survived by happenstance, but this assassin still remains at-large. We suspect this is the work of the Theocracy. Which, if true, means they may be trying to make a move, and one so close to the heart of the Duchy is... unacceptable."
>
> "In regard to catching the assassin, they have left a clue of their identity: they wielded a dagger that was shaped like a serpent. Such a crude weapon would only be used by those that worship Zehir."
>
> "Please keep an eye out for this would-be assassin. If this is the Theocracy, then your lives may be in danger too. You are hereby dismissed."
