## 1. In the Tower
The party is informed by Dioros that the tower can get around some predesignated locations in the underworld, but not much more than that. Dioros also mentions that there is a man who may be able to help — an elf by the name of Theriatis.

> If you truly wish to leave the underworld there is one person who might be able to help. He is an elf by the name of Theriatis. Theriatis doesn't leave the arena, so if he is still alive you might be able to find him there.

If the party asks why Dioros doesn't seek out Theriatis himself, then he says the following:

> Well... to keep a long story short, Theriatis and I have met once before and in that meeting he had taken his knife to my throat before I even had a chance to introduce myself. He had mistaken me for my brother, Priados, who apparently is not on good terms with the man. I wasn't about to stick around to clear things up — I teleported away as soon as I got the chance.
>
> I would avoid mentioning my name or my brother's name.

When the tower teleports:

> The stone walls of the tower shift and rumble, as the sound of rattling chains becomes overwhelming. In a moment of chaos, the tower is thrust through space and your vision begins to ebb and flow as objects begin to split into multiple images. And then, in the blink of an eye, all the images snap back into place, and the rumbling ceases. It takes a moment for you to regain your balance before everything settles down.

## 3. The Blood Pyxis
Approaching the Blood Pyxis:

>  The suspended arena looms above you, along with a host of winged fiends loitering on the ledges of the floating coliseum, looking down at you from hundreds of feet in the air.
>
> Down on the ground, ahead of you, are a number of large stone platforms. At the center of each is a chained pillar, with rusted chains going all the way up to the arena. These appear to be a number of elevator-platforms, as you see a huge, blue-skinned giant pulling at the chains to hoist them up to the arena.
>
> The giant turns towards you, with large tusks, and a slackjawed expression:
>  "Contestants or spectators?" he asks.

If the characters wish to spectate, the giant (named Pygos) will ask for 1 gold coin from each of them. Contestants are lifted for free.

The elevator-platforms meant for spectators will rise into one of the four vestibules within the Pyxis' outer chambers, while the platform meant for contestants will rise into the center of the arena (see the map).

Spectating:

> You peer out from one of the large arched openings that face the arena grounds just in time to witness the final moments of a battle between a large, wrinkled abomination with four stout trunks for legs, and 3 long arms that end in vicious claws. In a flourishing display, a duo of headless dwarves with warpicks flank either side of the monster and bring it to the ground before lodging their pickaxes in its face. The crowd erupts into a cheer that rattles the arena, and you can almost feel it swinging under your feet.
