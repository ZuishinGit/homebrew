# Traveling Tower of Kruu'Gal
This tower serves as the base of operations for Kruu'Gal the clean, a Nalfeshnee who dwells in the underworld. He can use it to travel around the different wards of the underworld. Kruu'Gal has a host of demonic henchmen who help him operate the magical tower.

## General Features
***Illumination.*** The tower is dark unless otherwise specified.
***Doors.*** Doors in the chamber are made of iron (AC 20; HP 20; DC 20)


## 1. Guarded Vestibule

> You enter a small vestibule that has four iron statues in each corner. Each statue depicts the horrific visage of men in terror. In front of you are a set of iron double doors; locked.

***Doors.*** The doors into the chamber have an arcane lock cast upon them, raising the DC to 30.
***Statues.*** The statues are inanimate until commanded to strike by one of the fiends in the tower, in which case they rise and mobilize.

## 2. Trough of Cleanliness
> This large chamber has a central trough of pristine water which seems to constantly bubble with effervescence. The basin is made of a green-tinted stone, and is supported by dozens small carvings of humanoids that are struggling to carry it off the ground. You see two larger statues on either side of it, depicting beautiful women with their hands in the water.

***The Trough.*** Anyone who drinks from the trough gains the effect of the catnap spell, immediately falling unconscious for 10 minutes. At the end of these 10 minutes, a creature also is restored as if they had been affected by the lesser restoration spell. 

## 3. Magical Laboratory
The door to this room is barred from the inside.

> You see two figures in the dark of this room, standing over an unlit iron brazier. One of these figures is a horrifying creature of bone-white skin stretched over its gaunt body. It looks like some kind of skeletal xenomorph, with a long tail that ends in a blood-stained stinger. It has strange insectoid wings that protrude from its back. The other figure appears to be some kind of frankenstein-esque experiment, with patchwork, leathery skin stretched over its large body. It wears tattered black robes, and has a slack-jawed expression on its face.
>
> Elsewhere in the room are a series of wooden shelves and desks.

###### Closer look at the Desks:

> Laid out on one of the desks is a sheet of thin, translucent parchment that has a bunch of arcane sigils written in a deep red ink. At a glance, it is unreadable. 

***Parchment.*** The parchment is a reference sheet for the operation of this tower's teleportation. When laid over the map in Area 7, it reveals which sigil chains correspond to which locations in Area 8.

***Treasure.*** The desks are filled with magic components. Anyone searching the desks finds a carved stone skull (*Sending Stone*; Kruu'Gal has the other one), a small golden statuette set with rubies (7,500 gp), and 3 alexandrite gemstones (500 gp), and enough magic components to put together 20 component pouches (500 gp). They would also find the very tip of a Behir tail, which still writhes around. 

***Behir Tail.*** A creature can use the behir tail as the material component for the lightning bolt spell. When doing so, the creature must succeed a DC 13 check using their spellcasting ability. On a success, you may forgo rolling the damage for the lightning bolt and instead deal maximum damage. On a failure, the spell fails. In either case, the behir tail is consumed. 

## 4. Lounge

> This room looks more comfortable than the rest. Against the southern wall is a black leather divan, in front of which is a large brass contraption from which rises a soft purple smoke. There are three hoses that protrude from it, with nozzles at the end of each. 
> 
> Opposite to the divan, on the northwestern wall is an oversized tapestry of beautiful swirling patterns.

###### Closer Look at the Tapestry:
> The swirling patterns are actually made of depictions of people suffering, being whipped, slaves bound in chains, small demonic entities, etc.

***Concealed Door.*** The tapestry covers a door leading to Area 5, noticeable with a DC 15 Perception check.

**Brass Contraption.** The brass contraption is a form of a hookah. It currently burns a fiendish poultice made of human bones and various herbs of the underworld. Anyone who smokes it must succeed a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the confusion spell for 1 hour. At the end of this hour, the creature is no longer confused, and immediately takes 22 (4d10) poison damage as they begin retching. A fiend who uses the contraption instead is affected by a bless spell for 1 hour.

## 5. Secret Trophy Room

> Against the wall of this small closet is a shelf, which houses four large tomes that are positioned to face you. Underneath each is a small plackard with what appear to be names — Rhamarim, Ilin, Uvetornos, Grofaris — none of them you recognize. Underneath the shelf is a small stone chest.
>
> To your left and to your right are tall stone statues of wizards with twisted expressions of horror on their face.  

***Trapped Chest.*** Disturbing the chest in any way, including opening it, triggers a poisoned tempest trap in the room. The chest is empty.

***Books.*** Each book is a spellbook of a 6th-level wizard, except for the rightmost, which is a collection of *Protective Verses*.
