# Matriarch's Grotto
###### Approaching the Grotto

> You can see in the distance a colossal rock in the shape of a skull. The rock has a large, dessicated tree that is grown from the side of the head, almost like an antler. The tree though naked, has sprawling branches. You see a flock of dark-winged harpies have made roost in the boughs of the dead tree. A dozen of them loiter around the tree now, watching your approach.

> You can see a feint firelight being emitted from the mouth of this skull-like rock, and a path that leads up to it.
