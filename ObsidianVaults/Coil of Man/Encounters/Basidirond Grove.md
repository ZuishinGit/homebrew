# Basidirond Grove

Type: Combat
Environment: Underworld

> You happen upon a sweet-smelling grove of brightly-coloured fungus. Splashes of violet and orange paint the diverse flora.
>  
> Disrupting the color of the grove are a handful of large, cup-shaped mushrooms which are releasing plumes of dark spores that look almost like smoke rising from a brazier.
>
> That's when you notice that their long stems begin to twitch, and in unison they charge towards you on fleshy insectoid-like legs.

Roster:
- Basidirond (4)

***Treasure.*** When the combat finishes, the characters notice one of the basidironds was standing in the remains of a Vol assassin. She has a rotting backpack with a *Potion of Speed*, 540 gp, a rotted map, and a large crystal orb. The rotting corpse is posed as if protecting the orb.

###### Investigation 18

> Buried in the refuse, you find a dirty needle.

The needle is actually a *Ghost Step Tattoo*.

***The Map.*** The map was crafted by a coven of underworld Night Hags, and details the Saprophytic Isle, as well as a Vol outpost on the banks of the Tartyx (this is actually a trapped base).
