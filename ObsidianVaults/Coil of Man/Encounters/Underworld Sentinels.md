# Underworld Sentinels

Type: Combat
Environment: Underworld

> The air around you begins to waver and you feel the cold brush of death wash over you. Hundreds of skeletal hands erupt from the ground and tear open a rift in the earth. Another similar rift opens, and then another, and before you know it, a group of clattering skeletons comes climbing out from the ground. You watch as two figures come crawling out like their skeletal brethren. These two figures are identical — hulking skeletons wearing ornate blackened armor, each with a pair of empty eye sockets that glow with a forboding purple. 
>
> As the group of skeletons stand before you, you hear a smattering of voices — as if many languages are being uttered at once — and you understand them as they groan the following words:
> 
> "This is no place for the living. You shall readily be made fit for this realm."

Roster:
- Phylaskia (2)
- Skeleton (8)

Treasure: One of the skeleton's blades is an unusually ornate *Acheron Blade Shortsword*, which is discovered with a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check. Anyone who picks up the sword is immediately cursed
